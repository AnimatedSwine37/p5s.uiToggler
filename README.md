# p5s.uiToggle
A [Reloaded II](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded-II/) mod for P5S Steam that makes it so you can toggle the UI with the press of a button. By default the button to do this is F2 but this can be changed to any button in the mod's configuration in Reloaded.

Note that disabling the UI when in menus will cause weirdness, I have no intention of fixing/changing this.

## Installation
